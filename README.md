# Vector Movie Search

## Overview

Vector Movie Search is a powerful application that leverages vector embeddings to perform efficient and accurate searches for movies based on user-defined queries. The application uses a combination of machine learning models, MongoDB for data storage, and ChromaDB for vector storage and retrieval.

## Features

- **Search Movies**: Quickly find movies based on title, description, or other attributes using natural language queries.
- **Embedding Generation**: Automatically generates vector embeddings for movie data using the Sentence Transformers library.
- **Efficient Retrieval**: Leverages ChromaDB for fast and scalable vector search capabilities.
- **Data Storage**: Uses MongoDB for structured data storage and management.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: The primary programming language for the application.
- **Sentence Transformers**: For generating movie embeddings.
- **MongoDB**: For storing movie data.
- **ChromaDB**: For managing vector embeddings and performing searches.
- **Streamlit**: (Optional) For building a user-friendly web interface.
